# Logistic Regression from Scratch

This project implements Logistic Regression from scratch using Python and NumPy without using any machine learning libraries.

## Concepts implemented

- Sigmoid function
- Binary cross entropy cost function
- Gradient descent optimization
- Model training
- Prediction
- Cost vs iteration visualization
- Logistic curve visualization

## Dataset

Input:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

Output:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

This represents a binary classification problem.

## How to run

Install dependencies:

pip install -r ../requirements.txt

Run:

python logistic_regression_bootcamp.py

## Output

- Learned weights and bias
- Predictions
- Cost vs iteration graph
- Logistic regression curve
